           "2 years ago I found this as best service centres among all in Immadihalli area. To check the problem in your latop they won't charge. Its done for free of cost but other service centres are demanding Rs.350/- to check the problem. I appreciate their patience in dealing with customers. I liked their attitude while answering and also not particular about mo ey. I paid Rs100/- extra for their good attitude."

Prices were reasonable as well. Really happy with service and have recommended them to couple of friends !!!"

           "I gave couple of my laptops for servicing (a bit old, hence, developed heating issues and needed heat sink paste replacement). Laptops were serviced and returned on the same day. One of the laptops had an issue with key board adapters clips (it broke). Fixed it as well in a smart way (not an easy task, I assume). Though I offered to pay for this additional work, did not charge any extra amount. As many have mentioned, very polite and professional engineers. I would visit them for any laptop servicing/spares👍"

           "It was a wonderful service with Timely management. Most of the so called highly reputed service centres gave the least hope for the services stating that it will no longer will work. So it's better go for a New one. But due to the professional staffs of SkyLap and their marvelous services my Laptop works absolutely fine now. The service charge was really affordable for the ppl like me. The location of this service centre is in the Whitefield which can be travelled easily from any location. I recommend the SkyLap for the trustable and fast services. Thank you Team for giving life to my Dell Laptop"

            Value After lot of struggles I found the perfect store. 
            This is gone be long, but read it because this is gone save you from lot of struggles. So,
             I had a blank screen issue with my Acer Predator Helios 300. I instantly called Acer customer 
             care and asked them for the authentic service center in Bangalore. They recommend one in Koramangala.
              The name of the store was Laptop Store. These guys for sure are authentic, but their technicians are not sound enough. 
              The only solution they came up with was a display update, which would cost me 20k. But that was not the solution, 
              because Acer had recommended few fixes on their website for this issue. It was a BIOS update issue, which didn't go well. Every laptop goes through a BIOS update after a year and if that doesn't 
              happen in a right way, it create issues. In my case display went blank, that doesn't mean the display was not working. The simple solution was a BIOS update (as recommended by Acer in their website). 
              But these guys were not willing to try that out, because they wanted to make money by selling me a new screen. So, I came back home and I started using external monitor via HDMI cable. It was all good. 
              Meanwhile, I got a recommendation from my dad's colleague, who looks into the network administration in his company. He recommended "eGlitz". So, we went their for second opinion thinking he would have some 
              idea with the BIOS update. We had showed him that the laptop was in working condition and only display was gone. This guy ended up shorting the laptop's motherboard. He was working in an apartment and not an office.
               I only considered him because of recommendation, but I ended up screwing my entire laptop (worth 1.5 lakhs). I thought if the company my dad works in is recommending it, then why doubt. But I was a fool. I am taking 
               this legally now with those guys. Meanwhile, I wanted somebody to exactly tell me what those guys had done. So I went to "SkyLab". I simple admire their work. Even authentic Acer centers doesn't have that work culture. 
               First, they took my charger, used a multimeter to check if the flow was correct in the charger, only then they touched my laptop. They opened it in front of me, and took my signature on all the internal devices of
                the laptop (this was an assurance by itself, I have never seen any store do this). Their service and follow up was really good. Their diagnosis charges were also less (Rs.200) when compared to authentic centers
                 who charge Rs.500. The building their shop is too old, but the shop itself is well maintained and hygienic. Much recommend for a hassle free and genuine service. (Definitely better than any authentic stores) `}
